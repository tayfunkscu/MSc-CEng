        "**Problem:** In a certain factory, machines are either made by company A or company B. Company A produces 60% of the machines, while company B produces the remaining 40%. 5% of the machines produced by company A are defective, while 10% of the machines produced by company B are defective. If a machine is randomly selected and found to be defective, what is the probability that it was produced by company B?\n",

We want to find **P(B|D)**, the probability that the machine was produced by company B given that it is defective.\n",
